- [Descope](https://www.descope.com/)
- [SvelteKit Auth](https://authjs.dev/reference/sveltekit)

## ‚öôÔ∏è Setup

1. In the root directory of the project, copy the .env.example to .env by running cp .env.example .env and include the following:

```
DESCOPE_ID="YOUR_DESCOPE_PROJECT_ID"
DESCOPE_SECRET="YOUR_DESCOPE_ACCESS_KEY"

AUTH_SECRET="YOUR_AUTH_SECRET"
```

- ```DESCOPE_ID``` - can be found in your Descope's account under the [Project page](https://app.descope.com/settings/project)
- ```DESCOPE_SECRET``` - can be generated in your Descope's account under the [Access Keys page](https://app.descope.com/accesskeys)
- ```AUTH_SECRET``` can be generated by the following command in your terminal (do not use the same generated value for both):

```AUTH_SECRET``` can be generated by the following command in your terminal:
```
$ openssl rand -base64 32
```

2. Setup SSO 

- To enable SSO and add Descope as an Identity Provider (IdP), we need to add our flow hosting URL: 
```
https://auth.descope.io/<YOUR_DESCOPE_PROJECT_ID>
```

- Navigate to Descope Project --> Authentication methods --> Identity Provider:

3. Once you've created a project and installed dependencies with `npm install` (or `pnpm install` or `yarn`), start a development server:

```
npm run dev

# or start the server and open the app in a new browser tab
npm run dev -- --open
```
